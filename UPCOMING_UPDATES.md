1. top left corner would write "start"
2. bottom right corner would write "finish"
3. it would create a maze of a size 4x4 (num_rows = 4 and num_cols = 4)
4. When the maze is created, user would start on "start" and use keyboard to navigate inside the maze (with W, A, S, D keys as up, left, down, right)
5. if a player gets to a finish line, it would say "level (number of level) complete"
6. it would ask if player want to continue. (using Y as yes and N as no)
7. if player selects yes, it would make a new maze, but the grid would increase by one. Example if player finished first level of 4x4 grid, it would increase to 5x5 so 5rows and 5cols.
