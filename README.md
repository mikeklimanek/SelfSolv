# SelfSolv
1) create a window
2) finishing window actions
3) implement main()
4) splitting into coresponding files
5) creating point and lines
6) compiled all back to main to find problems in code
7) created a test.py for easier testing
8) spreading back to each file
9) redefinided Line and Maze
10) centered the whole maze
11) increased number of cols and rows
12) added start and finish points
13) debugged and corrected code for test.py to work
14) found and solved a problem with start and finish points
15) breaking walls of cells to create a maze
16) self reset for cells visited
17) canvas line that connects a path used to solve the maze
18) updates to paths of solving line, correctly comes back from dead ends until it finds finish line
19) maze is now created faster, while SelfSolving line goes slower for showing purposes
